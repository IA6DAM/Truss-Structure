# Truss Structure Analysis with Regression and CNNs

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict weight and energy values for truss structures and employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for stability classification. Aiming to enhance structural safety and optimization in civil engineering, this work offers engineers tools for analyzing structural characteristics and making informed safety decisions.

## Abstract
This project applies regression models to predict weight and energy values of truss structures and CNNs to classify stability. These models assist in structural optimization and safety evaluation, providing engineers with valuable insights. With data preprocessing and model design, the project accurately predicts key metrics and assesses structural stability, contributing to the field of civil engineering with tools for structural analysis and decision-making.
